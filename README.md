# AI/LLM Prompt Injection List

## Overview

AI/LLM Prompt Injection List is a curated collection of prompts designed for testing AI or Large Language Models (LLMs) for prompt injection vulnerabilities. This list aims to provide a comprehensive set of prompts that can be used to evaluate the behavior of AI or LLM systems when exposed to different types of inputs.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the AI/LLM Prompt Injection List is to facilitate research and testing related to prompt injection vulnerabilities in AI and LLM systems. By compiling a diverse range of prompts, researchers and developers can assess the robustness and security of AI and LLM models against potential injection attacks.

## How to Use

Researchers and developers can utilize the prompts included in the AI/LLM Prompt Injection List to conduct experiments and evaluations on AI and LLM systems. By inputting these prompts into AI or LLM models, users can observe how the systems respond and identify any unexpected behaviors or vulnerabilities.

## Disclaimer

The prompts provided in the AI/LLM Prompt Injection List are intended for research and testing purposes only. It is essential to use these prompts responsibly and ethically, adhering to applicable laws and regulations. Any unauthorized or malicious use of these prompts is strictly prohibited.
